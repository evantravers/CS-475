This is intended to be the storage for my egg visualization. The process will be as thus: 

  1) Hard boil, and mark a "North" on the egg. 
  2) slice it, place it carefully on a marked sheet, take pictures of each
  3) shop the images to reduce to colors, so that you can then get data
  4) now that you have data, reconstruct a 3d representation of where the yoolk is.
